# ASL-American-Sign-Language-Gesture-Recognition

Predicted the correct sign performed by the user based on data collected from multiple sensors. Trained different models like SVM, Random Forrest, Neural Networks to draw comparison in their performances.

Collected raw data by doing physical imitations of various sign language actions and apply different extraction techniques to obtain meaningful data. Feature extraction methods (FFT, RMS, Variance, Mean, and SD) were used to obtain unique features.

PCA was performed to get the final feature matrix to reduce the data dimensionality.

This feature matrix is used to train different models for classification like SVM, Decision Trees and Neural Networks. The data is split for training (70%) and testing (30%).
